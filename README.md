# Joe-s-Coffee-Store
## Auditing the website of a coffee shop, and changing its markup from HTML4 to HTML5

From the Gill Cleeren pluralsight course on **Practical HTML5** this repository is aimed at converting the HTML4 markup on which the Joe's Coffee Store website was initially built with, to the more accessible HTML5 markup

The website features some of the newly added JavaScript enabled HTML5 features like Canvas, Drag and Drop APIs etc.
